    Hello, this is Dan, and in this episode, my friend, Mark and I were joined by guest Mark Williams to talk about what to do if you are looking for a brand new car and, of course, this is the car we've been testing for over three years and for what little that has been spent on it so far. Well, you know, as you may or may not remember, the car we're talking about here was launched last May in California, and this is in addition to some of the other cars that we test here in the city. And, again, thanks to Matt, my friend, for being on this episode and joining me, and the lovely Ben Kosters again, and Mark for talking to us and joining in on this as well. But now, we should address the big subject in this episode of the podcast.
    
    
    As you likely have guessed by now, I, and everyone here at Car and Driver, are all for the idea of owning a car, whether it's a sports car, a luxury SUV or an electric car, anywhere in the world, whenever that is. And certainly, that is what we would like to see on our road.
    
    
    So, I think that you'll like that we were willing to bring the subject of the car for the uninitiated, so take a listen to our conversation with Mark Williams now.
    
    So, Mark, as you probably recall in this episode, we spent some time in California with the first-gen Mazda3, and that car's still one of the more capable and powerful sports cars in the world, a couple of years after it was launched. It also had one hell of a range of up to 200 miles for about $24,000, depending upon what model you bought (we tested the Mazda3 in two different models with a range of less than 200 miles; there was no performance differences from the sedan. If someone bought an automatic with a range of that for $9,000, then the Mazda3 would have done fine. If someone bought a manual with the range set to 300 miles, it would be another story). So, our car has been great so far, and we would love to see it continue to be as well with the introduction of the second-gen model.
    
    
    Now, I'm not sure to what extent people would enjoy such a car. You'd think that they would love having the comfort of a rear-wheel drive and

    Hello, my name is Paul."
    
    "Nice. It's kind of a weird feeling, though."
    
    "I am."
    
    His expression froze. "You're... you're a vampire? I've seen you attack people, and the wounds look like a burn."
    
    Polly looked at her watch. "I have an appointment with the head of the Department of Dermatology," she explained.
    
    "That won't be necessary, unless you want to go into the hospital with me? Oh, and I have some... uh... medical notes I have to prove to the head. You need to have them signed to the hospital in the hospital, just in case we need it."
    
    "I'll get them signed now."
    
    "Good. You're supposed to tell them that there is a doctor at Dr. Black's clinic. There is... a girl there that needs something done, and Paul will take you to Dr. Black in about a half hour or so."
    
    The girls turned and left.
    
    Vampires, he thought; what does he know?
    
    He went to the hospital and looked for Dr. Black. He saw her, and left when he saw that she had an appointment.
    
    He arrived at the hospital, his eyes locked on the ceiling. "Oh God!" he shouted, stepping around a row of dead people, "What is this? This must be... some weird nightmare."
    
    A large and male hospital door opened. Paul walked into the waiting room, and sat at a large desk. He looked up. The door to his room was locked. "Is something wrong?"
    
    There was a knock on the door. He heard some noises, then the woman wearing blue sat, one arm around him and the other pushing him away. "Are you going to... sleep?"
    
    Paul stared, expecting to see the police, who were all lined up outside the door to his room. He nodded. "I don't know, I've gotten worse." He moved toward the door. The woman sat down next to him. "I think something has happened here."
    
    He took a sip of his drink. "I want to leave. I'm just afraid this may get worse."
    
    It did, and he began coughing and he almost died.

    Hello, my name is Joe Pappas; I'm the CEO and founder of the National Organization for Women (NOW). We're here to make sure reproductive rights are a key priority at every level of society, so that every woman has access to healthy, legal access to the reproductive healthcare necessary to protect her health and maximize her quality of life.
    
    I am also involved in the fight against the Zika virus, which affects a staggering 35 countries across the Americas, including the United States, South America, Latin America, China and Africa. Zika virus is the cause of massive population displacements that threaten the lives and safety of pregnant women and children everywhere. It is also the cause of an epidemic of birth defects that threatens the health and well-being of women, with effects across a wide range of age and socioeconomic distribution, including many women who are already carrying children. Zika virus continues to spread around the world from a single individual. In the U.S., about 16,000 cases have been reported, and three people are believed to be infected in North America through travel. In the U.S., Zika virus is transmitted primarily by Zika virus-positive female mosquitoes.
    
    I'm excited to talk to you about how we can provide access to affordable health care for all women in the United States, making sure women are treated in the safest manner possible, so we reduce their chances of getting this disease while also respecting rights and the right to privacy.
    
    Women deserve to know they have health insurance, and we need to empower them to participate fully in the health care decisions they make, from having the healthcare that will protect them, to not being told when they need contraception.
    
    We cannot allow these stories of healthcare loss and disruption to pass. By providing comprehensive access to affordable healthcare in the form of comprehensive care plan, women should be able to make informed, cost-effective choices about their health.
    
    Let me introduce you to the National Women's Health Network (NWWHN). NWWHN is a grassroots organization founded by a coalition of more than 100 prominent women's organizations in the U.S., and the only nationwide network of women's health resources to include coverage for maternity care in women's health plans under Medicare and Medicaid.
    
    This is an outstanding moment in the history of our nation. The federal government has agreed to fund the NWWHN. This is an incredibly important moment for American women: It will allow our nation's women to have access to

    Hello, and welcome. The best part about learning how to make pasta from scratch is in that it's completely up to you, and is easily customizable. This is great because you can mix up your own flavors!
    
    I'll show you in a moment how you can make your own sauce for your delicious homemade pasta, and then I'm going to take you from there to make these delicious homemade ricotta stuffed peppers, just on my list of favorite dishes.
    
    This recipe calls for homemade ricotta, of course. But you can substitute it with ricotta of your liking, but I'll be using it because they're just as much tasty. It also has a more nutty flavor to it than the regular ricotta. I like it best if you can use raw garlic instead of making a parmesan-type sauce. But if you can use raw garlic, you might want to add extra garlic to the ricotta if you use it in these recipes.
    
    
    Homemade Tomatoes and Pesto with Cashews
    
    I can't guarantee you will receive these super moist, and fresh tomatoes, but it does taste fantastic. You will get them at your local farmer's market. My favorite local market is the one at 464 E. Michigan Ave. in downtown Chicago. I think you can find it there, or use your internet search tool. You'll also get plenty of other great ingredients with your tomatoes.
    
    One of the other reasons I absolutely love homemade pasta is the homemade pesto! This is an amazingly fresh cheese to add to any dish. It's quite a good base or spread for cooking other cheese recipes, but most folks don't have good access to their closets or the kitchen. Or maybe they don't have a big parlor where they can get some basil, oregano or parmesan. So the best way I've found to get these out of your hand is by dipping the pasta into a fresh salad as well as making this recipe.
    
    Here's how you make this homemade pesto using cashews, and how you can store it, in the fridge. You'll only need to keep it for a small week or two if you want to keep it for a season, but I always keep my pesto on hand. I only put half of it in the jar from now on, and when you've needed a little extra. If you skip it and buy more when it's just right, or if

    Hello, howdy. How is life, you say?" He looked away, and I heard a soft thud. His hand was pressed to the wall of his room and he looked away again, and then he looked back, and then smiled and leaned back, as though nothing happened. His eyes were closed, and it was as if his soul was about to snap shut, like something that I had said while he was telling it to me: "A little girl is dyingâ"¦" He sighed. "No. I don't. But I've changed that, too. Not every night after my last birthday I had nightmares. But I stopped. And we got things in order. I guess I'm still alive, despite the whole 'oh shit!' feeling." The moment I said those words, another thud, my heart sank. He began to cry again, but at the same time his hands didn't reach for the wall and instead curled up into fists, one fist clenched with one hand; another fist clenched once more, clenching at his side. He smiled, a little smile full of worry and despair, and he reached out with his right hand to touch the wall of his room. He lifted up my head, leaned close, and whispered something into my ear. I blinked so hard my eyes rolled back with pain, I felt myself falling slowly into the bed, still holding onto the bedpost, my head throbbing, my heart beating loudly. I could only speak his name, but I couldn't say anything with a firm, clear voice with no pauses, no awkward pauses between words. I felt dizzy and dizzy, but I couldn't hear him, and my head felt like it was going to pop out of my skull. The doctor took my hands, and we stood there for a while, staring into the night, my eyes closed. He didn't stop talking, but his eyes were closed. He looked between us like he realized who I was, so I tried to keep my eyes open. He nodded while his mouth opened into a smile, for me to hear him say his name. He said: "Oh â"¦ it's fine. I think I'll go to sleep for now." He did not seem surprised nor surprised when we stopped talking. I started to crawl against my side, my legs dragging, my arms rubbing. My mouth felt wet from the tears at the corners of my eyes, and my head hurt too well to be able even to open

    Hello, there's no such thing as a bad apple."
    
    It's a good description, considering the circumstances of what transpired. The first thing I realized, being the child being transported, was there were several kids who were clearly crying in the car. With my heart pounding in my chest, I sat back up on the bed in shock. There were some other parents whose infants were in the back seat, as well â"5 some who were parents themselves â"5 and the adults that we knew and cared about had been pushed to the bottom of the pile: The very children they were supposedly supposed to protect and cherish. But the children were being transported to an unfamiliar location â"6 a foreign country! When the adults in our lives had been unable to provide us with a decent night's sleep, I felt compelled to provide that to them: I went into a panic and attempted to leave, but they were adamant that that wasn't OK.
    
    Once I had all of the information I needed to know about the situation, I asked for a full report, including photographs (that I would save for later), written by the child's father, in which I described the events leading up to their abduction, and why it was bad for my child's safety. (I hope to get a copy of that when I return to India!) My call didn't do any good: My mother was in tears, so my husband called for the other parents, and they told us they were too scared and upset to go forward. We went in search of a therapist by the name and alias that I'd seen on my television show, a woman named Sankara. Sankara worked closely with me and my husband. She was adamant about putting things in a more positive light:
    
    I had only ever seen my husband's wife's life as a series of mistakes. She was the first to realize that his wife is not good at their business, and that things happen where they shouldn't.
    
    My kids are all too happy now and love us as much as I loved them. My husband tells me that he has an overwhelming connection to them, that he always does. His oldest son even tells me that he does everything for his dad that's best.
    
    She can also speak fluently English and a bit Spanish, and in addition to all of her wonderful ideas and advice, has come up with a brilliant way to communicate the message that this is not a good move for us. The other parents

    Hello, my name is Michael J. Hennessey, but I'm much more at home at the University of Michigan. My field of study is engineering, though I am interested in every aspect of building and building applications. One of my main goals is to provide you with the best possible tools to build great software, which you can then bring to market using the latest technologies.
    
    Software engineering, or software engineering, refers to the analysis and design of computer programs and their interactions with and applications.
    
    There are a huge number of technical areas where we can apply some of our existing knowledge, and apply it in many of our applications. For instance, software engineering has a very strong application in computer audio, for audio-video conversion. That's really the focus here. When some of the existing tools out there that we could use today can't transform the audio to video format that we need, that would be really bad news for any audio software.
    
    We are looking to develop a software platform called FLOSS that allows computer software to work with FLOSS-based applications and applications written in the FLOSS ecosystem as if they were fully functional, and with much better performance and reliability than the existing software we have today.
    
    FLOSS is open source software that is freely shared, so anyone can jump in and improve the code based on contributions from any user base. The FLOSS code that we built for Linux includes hundreds of thousands of lines of code. Most of that code can be freely improved by anyone who knows how to write it.
    
    This project is very much a public service project designed primarily to help bring our own version of the Floss platform to market. It will be one of the few applications available which is licensed and supported by FLOSS, which represents the greatest possible amount of freedom for people.
    
    It's being built primarily primarily on Linux. The underlying framework is a pure FLOSS code base, but we've modified it to use more C++ and JavaScript to build the GUI and user interface for the Floss app.
    
    All current software engineers can use this platform to build a free application.
    
    FLOSS and its community of users make FLOSS as free as possible, to the best of our abilities. But that's a lot of effort. The FLOSS community, with its strong community of developers, has an excellent reputation for being responsive and willing to share any code for improvement. So we are also encouraging our community to let

    Hello, everyone.
    
    Thanks for coming along here and for being so patient as I started a trip of sorts from here on in. So I'll get started. To those who I haven't told; here is a short Q/A I found on my blog, here is a short thread on the forum and finally here's my travel itinerary before we're all off!
    
    So here I can walk you through the process for you so you know my method and what I'll need if I'm trying to travel from here to there.
    
    The main thing you have to be careful of is all the food you eat (on top of that, you should have plenty of spare money â"5 in India, you can find cheaper food or meat for less, too). If you eat anything (especially meat â"5 this stuff is cheap and it's all vegetarian, and the fresh veggies you get here are pretty amazing). You will definitely be starving when you get to your destination.
    
    First off, if you're at all like me, the first thing we tend to get is the cheap stuff â"5 if it's a cheap Indian restaurant and you get a lot of food, you are going to want something sweet. It's quite common and the locals like sweets with everything (especially beef, which I have been known to try some!). But if it's really good, I suggest you go for something more expensive and have it fresh (or canned on the side) instead of frozen. In either case, avoid food that is really hot (like hot food that's made by heating up butter and sugarâ"¦this might cause it to melt on the tongue and cause a mouth burn). If it's not hot, it's not sweet and it can ruin the taste of your food! So for this trip, I'll want to stick with a lot of organic, plain (or not frozen) food.
    
    On a quick note, try to steer clear of meat and non-animal products when you're eating. If you've ever had meat (sausage, hamburger, buns), meat and non-animal products in your life, you've probably had a bit of a food shock. You won't be enjoying the food as much (as we're doing here in India and it's definitely NOT okay!).
    
    And my biggest tip: always bring a glass of waterâ"¦this is vital for all of the food preparations we're making. In fact, I'll

    Hello to you all! I will be moving my wife to San Francisco soon, so your questions are welcome in my new home of San Francisco!
    
    *Edit 3/20/15* It will be a while before I'm free again :)
    
    1. Can you explain when you last got this message and why you are so grateful?
    
    2. Is it my name on there?
    
    3. Can I make an inquiry regarding any previous messages you have received? In general, are those messages any more relevant?
    
    4. Did you post any interesting photos recently?
    
    1. Yes! I was pretty busy, but I got another post by your wonderful guest this morning. This one got an overwhelming response so to speak. Yes, the posts you have received are indeed interesting. :)
    
    2. The messages that were there were not a lot, but were worth their weight in gold. They are my favorite!
    
    3. For those of you that have read my previous blog postsâ"6no, seriouslyâ"6you know I've never been an active reader, and it really does bother me when people assume that I'm not! If you're interested, I am interested to know why, please? I love what you do with your time.
    
    4. Well if that's the caseâ"6thanks for all the attentionâ"6but for someone like meâ"6a photographer interested in the world's most famous street artistâ"6this means I can no longer be a photo editor.
    
    And now I'll be moving back to Portland, Oregon to be with one of my adorable friends.
    
    *Edit 3/7/15* I'm so excited to be living with my new friend again, and this is going to be the BEST time of my life! ðA;$ Also I'm now a photographer again! Can't get any better than that!
    
    Edit 3/13/15* And let me tell you, it sounds like there has been quite an increase in posts since you last sent them out. So many people are sending these things and you're always such a lovely guy to have around! Thanks for all the kind words!
    
    Edit 3/12/15* I'm also starting off a new trend with a whole new line of new posters in the works that I think you may like to enjoy as well!
    
    *Edit 3/17/15* So I have a whole other article up! The one that gets
